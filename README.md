# linkedemail
Pulls staff names from linkedin and converts to email addresses.

Whilst this code does work (flawlessly, I might add), it requires about 2 minutes of user prep (instructions are given once running the script). It is a WORK IN PROGRESS, and I will update this to become more of a point and shoot script when time permits. 

Enjoy.
